# Face-tracking-with-Anime-characters
Hello! I have made a Python project where YURI from the game doki doki literature club accesses the webcam and stares directly into the player's soul. Hope you enjoy!

Requirements:
 - Python 3.5 or above
 - OpenCV
 - Numpy
 - PyGame

Clone this repository and run yuriblush.py
The pictures given below are saved in the assets folder.(you can also use your own waifus if you want)
Run the code and have fun with your waifu ... weeb

Make your own:

you will need only 2 images
1) character without eyes
![yuriwoeyes](assets/yuri_no_eyes.bmp)
2) eyes
![eyes](assets/only_eyes.png)
 just use those images instead and you are good to go!

<h1>Version 2: Yuri now has proximity </h1>
<p>
If you move your face close to the webcam, she blushes!
<br>
Just run the yuriblush.py file and you're good!
</p>
